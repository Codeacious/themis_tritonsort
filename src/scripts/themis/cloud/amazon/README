1. Launch an instance of Amazon Linux as the base AMI for the Themis AMI you will build.
  - Recommended to use amzn-ami-hvm-2014.03.2.x86_64-ebs - ami-76817c1e
  - If using the 2014.03 AMI above, use Lock-On-Launch to prevent the AMI from auto-upgrading to the newest version:
    - Pass the following text in for Userdata:
#cloud-config
repo_releasever: 2014.03

2. Run AMI/install_themis.py from your local workstation to install Themis on the virtual machine you just booted.

3. Create an Amazon Virtual Machine Image (AMI) from that VM.

4. Run launch_ec2_cluster.py from your local workstation to launch a Themis cluster using this AMI.
