This code is made available under 3-clause BSD (see LICENSE file), and is
provided for mainly for eductional purposes. We will not be supporting this
codebase moving forward, so please don't ask for feature requests, bug fixes,
or runtime support. Themis and TritonSort are research prototypes, and were
built for our research testbeds. They may not run on arbitrary platforms, and
significant effort may be required to run them.

In order to generate data for the GraySort application, gensort and valsort
programs must be obtained from http://sortbenchmark.org/. More information is
available at http://www.ordinal.com/gensort.html. In order to integrate these
programs with our test infrastructure, you must place the binaries in
src/gensort_2013 and rename the executables to `gensort_2013' and
`valsort_2013' as specified in the README in that directory. These programs are
not required to run Themis, but may be useful for data generation and
validation.

Themis MapReduce supports a port of the CloudBurst project
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloudburst-bio/). To access this port, see
http://themis.sysnet.ucsd.edu/. Place these files in
src/tritonsort/mapreduce/functions/map/cloudBurst and
src/tritonsort/mapreduce/functions/reduce/cloudBurst.
